; Windows installer for hdrmerge-timelapser (Inno Setup).
;
;     iscc packaging\hdrmerge-timelapser.iss
;
; Build the payload first -- `pwsh packaging\make-win.ps1` lays down the
; embeddable Python, the wheels, the launcher and the icon under
; dist\hdrmerge-timelapser\, and writes dist\version.txt. This wraps that folder
; into a Setup that installs to Program Files, drops a Start-menu shortcut, and
; registers an uninstaller. Same bytes the zip carries; this is the
; unpack-for-you face of it.
;
; There is no frozen exe, on purpose: PyInstaller's bootloader trips a Defender
; false positive (`Program:Win32/Vigram.A`) that truncated the old compiled
; installer to "setup files are corrupted". An embeddable Python is ordinary
; files, so Defender leaves it alone -- and this installer runs.
;
; **Not signed.** The Setup.exe still trips SmartScreen the first time -- a
; code-signing certificate is a yearly cost this project does not carry. The
; shortcut launches the windowed interpreter on the package; there is no console.

; The GPL is shown at install time. Not a click-through EULA -- the GPL grants
; rather than restricts, and nobody has to accept it to *use* the program --
; but it is what governs the copy of HDRMerge inside, so it is put in front of
; the person rather than buried in a subfolder they will never open.

; The plain-text render, not the .md: Inno shows this verbatim and does not read
; Markdown, so the .md's headings, bold and table would leak their raw syntax
; here. make-win.ps1 writes the .txt beside the .md with md_to_text.py.

; lzma, not lzma2. On this payload Inno's lzma2 codec writes a stream that its
; own decompressor rejects at install ("lzmadecomp: Compressed data is
; corrupted") on a large required DLL -- numpy's bundled OpenBLAS, ~20 MB, which
; cannot be pruned the way the QML tools were. The source file is intact and the
; plain lzma (v1) codec compresses it to the same size without the fault, so the
; whole build hangs on this one word. SolidCompression stays off so a bad block
; can never poison more than its own file.

[Files]
; The whole payload, recursively. recursesubdirs+createallsubdirs keeps the
; embeddable Python's Lib\site-packages tree intact -- imports fail without it.
; Excludes the bytecode caches. make-win.ps1 strips __pycache__ before it zips,
; so the zip is clean; but iscc runs later, and anything that executes the
; payload in between (a verification run, a curious double-click) writes fresh
; .pyc whose co_filename is the build checkout's absolute path -- the very path
; this build works to keep out. The .pyc are regenerated on first run, so
; excluding them costs nothing and makes the installer immune to that timing.
